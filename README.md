This example demonstrates a common error in Haskell related to type constraints and the `sort` function from `Data.List`.  The `sort` function requires an `Ord` instance for the data type it operates on.  Strings have an `Ord` instance for lexicographic ordering, but if you attempt to treat a string as a list of numbers, you get a type error.  The solution shows how to properly sort a list of numbers and how to sort a string alphabetically using the same function.
